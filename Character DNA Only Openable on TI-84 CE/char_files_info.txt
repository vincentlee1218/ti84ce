The files in this folder are sorted out according to the contents they contain.

How to use the files:
Look at the files on a TI-84 CE. There is a number/character combination on the left, such as 25 or BB24. When you enter this character into the hexadecimal editor (ZHEDIT) the text on the right will be applied into the program.
The reason you must open the files on the TI-84 CE is because the TI Connect CE program will not be able to open some files due to compatibility issues.

Files in this folder:
CHAR005B.8xp contains the list for groups of characters (such as 5Cxx).
T7240.8xp contains the entire letter set that can be used on the TI-84 CE. A better way to input these functions is to use TI Connect CE and insert the characters from the menu or the keyboard.
T7240EXE.8xp is a quick way to paste the letters into a program. 2nd sto> prgm [scroll to t7240exe] enter enter. Then separate the letter you want to use and then use in program.
T7241.8xp contains all the characters in the groups (5C, 5D, 5E, 60, 61, 62, 63, 7E, AA, BB).
T7242.8xp contains the characters in groups 5C-AA
T7243.8xp contains the characters in groups 5C-7E
