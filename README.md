# ti84ce
Welcome to the ti84ce repository, containg the files that are stored on the TI-84 CE.

# Size of each file
The file sizes are relatively small. Each App does not take more than 400 KB on the disk, which is very small when compared to computer installers. The PDF resources in the main folder take more space than the TI calc files.

# Outline
Apps: The Apps folder contains the TI-84 Plus CE bundle, the OS for TI-84 Plus CE, and all the apps that are included on the caluclator.\
Character DNA Only Openable on TI-84 CE: This is a folder that contains the characters that the TI-84 Plus CE uses.\
Legacay Message System - Inbox Express and Mail is powered by Webapp. The menu interface used in these programs is the old version with "Mail by Webapp". This version has been succeeded by a new version that removed the "Mail by Webapp" heading and only included the message number and ID.
