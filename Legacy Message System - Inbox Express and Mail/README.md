# Legacy Message System - Inbox Express and Mail

Made by Webapp

The following files in this folder are part of the Legacy Message System that was used on my system until the UI update that was applied summer of 2018.

The entire collection is only 80.2 KB, so users can quickly download the files onto their TI-84 Plus CE.

The special thing about these programs is that you can seamlessly get from one place to another through an entire ZGSHTDWN (Colorado Time Systems) program that features an expansive menu to different applications.

ZGINSRLE.8xp - Insert token program that recreated a scene from Gravity Falls.\
ZGMBOXLE.8xp - Your one stop place for email.\
ZM######.8xp - Various messages. They can all be navigated to (see note above).\
ZMTHETATHETATHETATHETA01.8xp - The template used for all the messages in the program.

Collections:\

ZM355000          - Messages to Bowfire Inc specifically created by the staff of Bowfire Inc. Minecraft\

ZM945718          - Insert Token Game\

Keep in mind that the messages are not actually real, but can be used as a form of entertainment. In a way, these messages are a snapshot of my journal in program form.

The new system uses a simplified numbering system. To recall the new UI for a specific message take the last four digits and put in as prgmZM####.
