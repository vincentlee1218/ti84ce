# Installing Apps onto your TI 84 Plus CE
To install files onto the TI-84 Plus CE, open TI Connect CE, connect your calculator, and then use the Send Files to Calculator option on the top left to select the files that you want to send.

After clicking "open" to select the files, wait a few moments for the files to be processed into the system, then select where you want to store the files on the calculator (RAM or Archive, some places cannot be moved to RAM or Archive depending on the file type).

When you click "Send", the files are then transferred to the calculator. Do not unplug the calculator or the files may be lost.

The OS is a .8eu file, the apps are .8ek files, and the bundle is a .b84 file.

# Notice for Apps

The folder provided has a TI Bundle, which includes the OS and all relevant Apps for the TI-84 Plus CE. If you are installing all the apps (including TestGuard), select all files but then deselect the TI84CEBundle file so that the OS does not reinstall during the sending process. If you are not installing the OS deselct both the TI84CEBundle (.b84) and the TI84 Plus CE OS file (.8eu)
