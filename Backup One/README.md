In addition to the current folders that are provided here, the current files on my TI-84 Plus CE are found here.

With the new getKey function discovered, a revision was created that implemented this new features. In addition, more files are to be added soon.

# Update of December 19, 2018

I have finally finished revising the programs and this marks a milestone. In total there are 76 files for the calculator. 39 of them are programs, another 36 are messages, and another one is a group containing the 39 programs.

# Update of December 18, 2018

No major changes to existing programs.\
prgmWANNACRY is just a simulation and does not encrypt your files. My version of the WannaCry virus on a TI-84 Plus CE.\
prgmZGCDDISC is a CD-ROM program. Please don't try to insert a CD as only a small CD is supported (not the regular music CD size).\
prgmZGCONVRT lets you convert between different units. Right now it is only available in air pressure.\
prgmZGCOUNT is a counter for your device.\
prgmZGERASE will erase existing vars on your device, whether archived or not.\
prgmZGFILEEX **NEW!** getKey function implemented. Now you **can** navigate through files with the arrow keys, clear button, and enter.\
prgmZGINSRTN has always been the same, except for revisions in the Return to Mail function.

Thank you and have a great time exploring programs!
